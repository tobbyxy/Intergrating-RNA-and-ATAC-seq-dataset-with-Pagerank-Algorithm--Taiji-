Problem Statement
Healthy placenta development is critical for a successful pregnancy, and requires tightly controlled gene regulation. While  the gene regulatory network governing placenta development has been studied, 
alot is still unknown about the placenta cell specific driver transcription factors.

Method
Here we integrated early placenta development RNA and ATAC seq dataset using the page rank algorithm. The pagerank algorithm identifies important driver transcription factors which are ranked according to a page rank score.

Conclusion
We identified new driver transcription factors for placenta development LHX6, Xbp1m Nrf1, Irf1 at E7.5 and also confirmed already known placenta transcription factors from our analysis Gata, Foxd, ctcf.

Taiji result will be further validated with other methods.
